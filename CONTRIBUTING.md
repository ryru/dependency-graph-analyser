# Contributing to DGA

Pull requests (PR) are welcome. Here are some tips to consider to land new PR in the main branch.

## Ways to contribute

You can help make DGA a better tool by:

* Raise an issue if you discover a bug.
* Contribute bug fixes, new features or enhancements.

## Before opening a PR

When proposing new features or enhancements, we strongly recommend opening an issue first so that
the problem being solved and the implementation design can be discussed. This helps to avoid time
being invested in code that is never eventually merged, and also promotes better designs by
involving the community more widely.

For straightforward bug fixes where the issue is clear and can be illustrated via a failing unit,
please just open a PR.

Make sure `./gradlew check` passes.
